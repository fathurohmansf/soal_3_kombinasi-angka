- Combination Generation: Generate all possible combinations of letter sequences from the input digits, following the A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26 mapping, given that all digits must be represented in the result.
- Count Display: Display the total number of valid letter combinations found.
- Combinations Display: Show a list of valid letter combinations, with an option to display the combinations as both letters and corresponding digit sequences.
